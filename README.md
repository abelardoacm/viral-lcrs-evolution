# Viral LCRs Evolution 🧬🦠

Welcome to our project on the evolutionary study of Low Complexity Regions (LCRs) in viral genomes! This project uses various computational tools and statistical methods to analyze and understand the functional and evolutionary implications of LCRs in viruses.

## Project Overview 👀

In this project, we aim to investigate:

1. The prevalence of LCRs in viral genomes.
2. The potential roles of these regions in viral lifecycle and host interactions.
3. The evolutionary pressures shaping these regions and their maintenance.
